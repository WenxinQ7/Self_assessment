        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Pandas have distinctive black and white fur, which is thought to
          provide camouflage in their natural habitat of bamboo forests. They
          have an enlarged wrist bone that acts like a thumb, which helps them
          grasp bamboo stems and leaves with great dexterity. Despite their
          size, pandas are excellent climbers and swimmers.

        <h2>Diet and Eating Habits</h2>
        <p>
          Pandas are primarily herbivores and their diet consists almost
          entirely of bamboo. They can consume large quantities of bamboo in a
          single day. Despite being classified as carnivores, their digestive
          system is more similar to that of herbivores, which means they don't
          extract all the nutrients from bamboo, leading to frequent feeding.
          Pandas have a "thumb" on their front paws, which helps them strip
          bamboo leaves and stems efficiently.

      <section>
        <h2>Reproduction and Cubs</h2>
        <p>
          Female pandas are only in estrus (receptive to mating) for a few days
          each year, making breeding in captivity and in the wild challenging.
          Giant panda cubs are born extremely small and vulnerable, often
          weighing less than 5 ounces (140 grams) at birth. Mothers are highly
          protective of their cubs, and they typically care for them for about
          18 months to 2 years before they become more independent.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Conservation and Status</h2>
        <p>
          Giant pandas are an endangered species, with a majority of them living
          in the mountainous regions of China. Conservation efforts, including
          habitat protection and breeding programs, have helped increase the
          panda population in recent years. The panda has become an
          international symbol of wildlife conservation and is often used as a
          mascot for environmental causes. Pandas are considered a "umbrella
          species," which means that by protecting their habitat, other species
          that share their ecosystem also benefit.
